# `svgn`

`svgn` is an API-compatible native Rust port of `ref/svgo`, the JS SVG optimizer, along with all its plugins. It can be integrated into desktop and CLI workflows, or transpiled to Wasm for use in web applications. It is aimed to be extremely fast, and to be functionally fully compatible with `svgo`.
