### Next Steps
The three initial plugins are complete and tested. Ready to continue with Phase 3 - Full Plugin Porting.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-02

### Added
- ✅ Implemented two more optimization plugins:
  - `cleanupAttrs` - Cleans up attributes from newlines, trailing and repeating spaces with configurable options

### Progress
- 5 plugins now implemented out of 50+ total plugins

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-02

### Added
- ✅ Implemented `cleanupIds` plugin with full functionality:
