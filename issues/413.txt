Now /report and review all problems mentioned @TODO.md and @PLAN.md and those mentiond in @issues/ and remove the issue files that no longer apply, and remove (clean) tasks or issues that no longer apply from @TODO.md and from @PLAN.md and then think very hard about the full codebase (check ./llms.txt which is a snapshot ), and then fully rewrite `./PLAN.md` so that itâ€™ll be a very detailed, complete, readable specification for the upcoming development. Remember, the goal is that we get 100% feature parity and 100% API compatibility with the JS @ref/svgo code. Reflect, review, refine and revise @PLAN.md in several deep-thought iterations. Then adapt @PLAN.md to @TODO.md so that @TODO.md becomes a simple detailed flat itemized list of tasks, each prefixed with `- [ ]`.
