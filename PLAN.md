# SVGN Development Plan: Organized by Dependency Threads

## 1. Executive Summary

SVGN is a high-performance Rust port of SVGO that has achieved 90.5% plugin implementation. This plan organizes all development tasks into dependency-based threads that can be worked on independently or in parallel, enabling efficient resource allocation and parallel development.

**Current Status (2025-07-05):**
- ‚úÖ **48/53 plugins** implemented (90.5% complete - 5 plugins remaining)
- ‚ùå **PROJECT CANNOT COMPILE** - 22 compilation errors blocking all development
- ‚ùå **5 plugins** remaining for 100% parity: mergePaths, moveElemsAttrsToGroup, moveGroupAttrsToElems, applyTransforms, reusePaths

**üö® CRITICAL PRIORITY: Thread A (Build Fixes) must be completed before any plugin development can continue.**

## 2. Thread-Based Development Strategy

Tasks are organized into 21 independent threads (A-U) based on their dependencies. Each thread is marked as **EASY**, **MEDIUM**, or **HARD** complexity, allowing developers to choose appropriate tasks based on their expertise and available time.

### 2.1. Critical Path Threads (Must be completed in order)

**Thread A ‚Üí Thread B ‚Üí Thread P ‚Üí Thread U**

These threads form the minimum viable path to 100% SVGO plugin parity.

### 2.2. WebAssembly Path (Can be developed in parallel)

**Thread D ‚Üí Thread E ‚Üí Thread F ‚Üí Thread H ‚Üí Thread I ‚Üí Thread J**

Complete WebAssembly implementation with online tool, independent of core plugin development.

### 2.3. Independent Threads (Can be developed anytime)

**Threads C, G, M, N, O, Q, R, S, T**

These have no dependencies and can be worked on by any team member at any time.

## 3. Thread A: Critical Build Fixes (HARD) ‚ö° BLOCKING

**Dependencies:** None - must be completed before any other work can proceed
**Complexity:** Hard - requires deep understanding of Rust crate versioning and CSS selector APIs
**Estimated Duration:** 1-2 weeks
**Required Skills:** Expert Rust, CSS parser internals, dependency management

### 3.1. Current Build Failure Analysis

‚ùå **22 compilation errors** completely blocking development:
- **cssparser version conflicts** between lightningcss v0.33.0 and selectors crate expecting v0.31.2
- **ToCss trait missing** for String types in SelectorImpl implementations  
- **PrecomputedHash trait missing** for String types used as Identifier/LocalName
- **MatchingContext API mismatch** - function expects 6 parameters, code provides 4
- **Parser trait missing** for SvgSelectorImpl in SelectorList::parse() calls
- **Method resolution failures** - unescape() method not found on BytesText
- **Private field access** - SelectorList.0.iter() accessing private field

### 3.2. Resolution Strategy

1. **Dependency Alignment:** Resolve cssparser version conflicts between crates
2. **Trait Implementation:** Add missing trait implementations for String types
3. **API Updates:** Update function calls to match current selectors crate API
4. **Access Pattern Fixes:** Replace private field access with public APIs

### 3.3. Success Criteria

## 10. Resource Allocation Strategy

### 10.1. Team Size Recommendations

**Single Developer:**
1. Start with Thread A (critical path)
2. Continue with Thread B (plugin completion)
3. Parallelize with independent threads (M, Q, R) during breaks

**Small Team (2-3 developers):**
1. **Developer 1:** Thread A ‚Üí Thread B (critical path)
2. **Developer 2:** Thread D ‚Üí Thread E ‚Üí Thread F (WebAssembly)
3. **Developer 3:** Independent threads (M, N, Q, R)

**Larger Team (4+ developers):**
- **Critical Path Team:** Threads A, B, P, U
- **WebAssembly Team:** Threads D, E, F, G, H, I, J
- **Infrastructure Team:** Threads M, N, O, Q, R, S, T
- **QA Team:** Threads K, L

### 10.2. Complexity-Based Assignment

**HARD Threads (Senior developers):**
- Thread A: Critical Build Fixes
- Thread B: Remaining Core Plugins

**MEDIUM Threads (Mid-level developers):**
- Threads C, E, F, H, I, L, N

**EASY Threads (Junior developers or parallel work):**
- Threads D, G, J, K, M, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U

## 11. Success Metrics and Timeline

### 11.1. Milestone Targets

**Week 1-2:** Thread A completion (Build fixes)
**Week 3-6:** Thread B completion (Core plugins)
**Week 7:** Thread P completion (Default preset alignment)
**Week 8:** Thread U completion (Documentation updates)

**Parallel Track:**
**Week 1-9:** WebAssembly threads (D ‚Üí E ‚Üí F ‚Üí H ‚Üí I ‚Üí J)

### 11.2. Quality Gates

- [ ] **100% SVGO Output Compatibility:** Bit-for-bit identical output for test cases
- [ ] **Performance Benchmark:** Maintain 2-3x speed advantage over SVGO
- [ ] **Test Coverage:** 367+ tests passing with new plugin integration
- [ ] **CLI Compatibility:** All SVGO parameters and options supported

### 11.3. WebAssembly Success Metrics

- [ ] **Bundle Size:** WASM + JS < 2MB compressed
- [ ] **Load Time:** Initial load < 3 seconds on 3G
- [ ] **Browser Support:** All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] **API Compatibility:** Match SVGO JavaScript API

## 12. Risk Mitigation

### 12.1. Critical Path Risks

**Thread A Failure:** If build fixes prove too complex, consider:
- Downgrading CSS dependencies to compatible versions
- Implementing alternative CSS processing approach
- Seeking community support for dependency resolution

**Thread B Complexity:** If plugin implementation exceeds estimates:
- Implement MVP versions first
- Focus on default preset plugins only
- Consider community contributions for advanced features

### 12.2. WebAssembly Risks

**Bundle Size Concerns:**
- Implement aggressive feature flags
- Use tree-shaking and dead code elimination
- Consider streaming/lazy loading for large plugins

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Maintain JavaScript fallback options
- Implement progressive enhancement
- Test across target browser matrix

## 13. Long-term Vision

This thread-based approach enables:

1. **Parallel Development:** Multiple teams can work simultaneously
2. **Flexible Resource Allocation:** Match developer skills to thread complexity
3. **Risk Distribution:** Failure in one thread doesn't block others
4. **Community Contributions:** Clear, independent tasks for external contributors
5. **Incremental Delivery:** Each completed thread provides immediate value

The goal is not just 100% SVGO parity, but a sustainable, extensible platform that can evolve beyond the original SVGO feature set while maintaining compatibility and performance advantages.
