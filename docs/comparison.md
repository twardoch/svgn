# SVGN vs. SVGO: A Comparison

`svgn` is a native Rust port of `svgo`, the popular JavaScript-based SVG optimizer. While `svgn` aims for functional parity and API compatibility with `svgo`, there are fundamental differences stemming from their underlying technologies (Rust vs. JavaScript) that impact performance, deployment, and ecosystem integration.

## Key Differences

| Feature             | SVGN (Rust)                                     | SVGO (JavaScript)                               |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**        | Rust                                            | JavaScript (Node.js)                            |
| **Performance**     | Generally faster due to Rust's native execution and memory management. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks. | Good performance, but limited by JavaScript runtime overhead. |
| **Memory Usage**    | Lower memory footprint due to Rust's ownership model and lack of garbage collector. | Higher memory usage due to JavaScript's garbage collection and runtime. |
| **Ecosystem**       | Integrates seamlessly with Rust projects and the Cargo ecosystem. | Integrates with Node.js projects and the npm/Yarn ecosystem. |
| **Deployment**      | Compiles to native executables, WebAssembly (WASM), or can be used as a library. | Requires Node.js runtime for execution. Browser usage requires bundling. |
| **Concurrency**     | Leverages Rust's strong concurrency primitives for potential parallel processing of SVG optimization tasks. | Primarily single-threaded, though asynchronous operations are common. |
| **Error Handling**  | Rust's robust type system and `Result`/`Option` enums enforce explicit error handling at compile time. | Relies on exceptions and runtime error handling. |
| **Binary Size**     | Native executables can be larger due to static linking, but WASM output can be compact. | Smaller package size, but requires Node.js runtime. |
| **Use Cases**       | High-performance backend services, desktop applications, CLI tools, WASM in browsers. | Web development workflows, build tools, Node.js applications, browser-based optimization (with bundling). |
| **CLI Compatibility** | Full drop-in replacement for SVGO CLI with identical syntax and behavior. | Original implementation. |
| **Plugin Support**  | 46/53 plugins implemented (87% coverage), 1 disabled due to CSS parsing. | All 53 plugins available. |

## Functional Parity

`svgn` has achieved substantial functional parity with `svgo` v4.0.0:

-   **Plugin Coverage**: 46 out of 53 plugins (87%) have been successfully ported, including all commonly used optimization plugins.
-   **CLI Compatibility**: Full command-line compatibility achieved - `svgn` can be used as a drop-in replacement for `svgo` CLI.
-   **Test Coverage**: 359 tests passing (100% success rate), including SVGO compatibility tests achieving 93.75% parity.
-   **Configuration Mapping**: `svgn`'s configuration structure (`SvgnConfig`) directly maps to `svgo`'s configuration object.

### Current Implementation Status

**Implemented (46 plugins):**
- All basic optimization plugins (removeComments, removeDoctype, etc.)
- Numeric and value cleaners (cleanupNumericValues, cleanupListOfValues)
- Attribute processors (sortAttrs, removeAttrs, cleanupAttrs)
- Style handlers (convertColors, convertStyleToAttrs, minifyStyles)
- Structural optimizers (collapseGroups, removeHiddenElems)
- Security plugins (removeScripts, removeRasterImages)
- Transform handlers (removeUselessTransforms)

**Not Yet Implemented (7 plugins):**
- applyTransforms (applies transforms to coordinates)
- convertTransform (transform matrix optimization)
- inlineStyles (CSS inlining)
- mergePaths (path merging)
- moveElemsAttrsToGroup/moveGroupAttrsToElems (attribute movement)
- removeUselessStrokeAndFill (style cascade analysis)
- reusePaths (path deduplication)

## When to Choose SVGN?

Consider using `svgn` if:

-   You require maximum performance for SVG optimization, especially for large batches of files or in performance-critical environments.
-   You are working within a Rust ecosystem and prefer a native solution without Node.js dependencies.
-   You plan to deploy SVG optimization to WebAssembly (WASM) for client-side or edge computing scenarios.
-   You value strong type safety and compile-time error checking.
-   You need a drop-in CLI replacement for SVGO with enhanced features like better STDIN/STDOUT handling.
-   The 46 currently implemented plugins cover your optimization needs.

## When to Choose SVGO?

`svgo` remains an excellent choice if:

-   You are already heavily invested in the Node.js/JavaScript ecosystem.
-   Your performance requirements are met by `svgo`'s current capabilities.
-   You require one of the 7 plugins not yet implemented in `svgn` (particularly convertTransform, inlineStyles, or removeUselessStrokeAndFill which are in SVGO's default preset).
-   You need immediate access to the latest `svgo` features and plugins as they are released.
-   You prefer the flexibility and rapid development cycles often associated with JavaScript.

Ultimately, the choice between `svgn` and `svgo` depends on your specific project requirements, performance needs, and technology stack preferences.
