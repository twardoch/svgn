# SVGN vs. SVGO: A Comparison

`svgn` is a native Rust port of `svgo`, the popular JavaScript-based SVG optimizer. While `svgn` aims for functional parity and API compatibility with `svgo`, there are fundamental differences stemming from their underlying technologies (Rust vs. JavaScript) that impact performance, deployment, and ecosystem integration.

## Key Differences

| Feature             | SVGN (Rust)                                     | SVGO (JavaScript)                               |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Language**        | Rust                                            | JavaScript (Node.js)                            |
| **Performance**     | Generally faster due to Rust's native execution and memory management. Ideal for CPU-bound tasks. | Good performance, but limited by JavaScript runtime overhead. |
| **Memory Usage**    | Lower memory footprint due to Rust's ownership model and lack of garbage collector. | Higher memory usage due to JavaScript's garbage collection and runtime. |
| **Ecosystem**       | Integrates seamlessly with Rust projects and the Cargo ecosystem. | Integrates with Node.js projects and the npm/Yarn ecosystem. |
| **Deployment**      | Compiles to native executables, WebAssembly (WASM), or can be used as a library. | Requires Node.js runtime for execution. Browser usage requires bundling. |
| **Concurrency**     | Leverages Rust's strong concurrency primitives for potential parallel processing of SVG optimization tasks. | Primarily single-threaded, though asynchronous operations are common. |
| **Error Handling**  | Rust's robust type system and `Result`/`Option` enums enforce explicit error handling at compile time. | Relies on exceptions and runtime error handling. |
| **Binary Size**     | Native executables can be larger due to static linking, but WASM output can be compact. | Smaller package size, but requires Node.js runtime. |
| **Use Cases**       | High-performance backend services, desktop applications, CLI tools, WASM in browsers. | Web development workflows, build tools, Node.js applications, browser-based optimization (with bundling). |

## Functional Parity

`svgn`'s primary goal is to achieve full functional parity with `svgo` v4.0.0. This means that for a given SVG input and configuration, `svgn` should produce an identical (or byte-for-byte equivalent) optimized SVG output as `svgo`.

-   **Plugin Porting**: All `svgo` plugins are being systematically ported to `svgn`, ensuring that the same optimization rules and logic are applied.
-   **Test Suite Replication**: `svgn` utilizes a comprehensive test suite that includes many of `svgo`'s original test cases, ensuring that the output matches the reference implementation.
-   **Configuration Mapping**: `svgn`'s configuration structure (`SvgnConfig`) is designed to directly map to `svgo`'s configuration object, allowing for easy migration of existing `svgo` configurations.

## When to Choose SVGN?

Consider using `svgn` if:

-   You require maximum performance for SVG optimization, especially for large batches of files or in performance-critical environments.
-   You are working within a Rust ecosystem and prefer a native solution without Node.js dependencies.
-   You plan to deploy SVG optimization to WebAssembly (WASM) for client-side or edge computing scenarios.
-   You value strong type safety and compile-time error checking.

## When to Choose SVGO?

`svgo` remains an excellent choice if:

-   You are already heavily invested in the Node.js/JavaScript ecosystem.
-   Your performance requirements are met by `svgo`'s current capabilities.
-   You need immediate access to the latest `svgo` features and plugins as they are released (as `svgn` will have a slight lag for porting).
-   You prefer the flexibility and rapid development cycles often associated with JavaScript.

Ultimately, the choice between `svgn` and `svgo` depends on your specific project requirements, performance needs, and technology stack preferences.
