## Technical Details

All tools are built using:

- **Backend**: SVGN (Rust) compiled to WebAssembly
- **Frontend**: Modern JavaScript with progressive enhancement
- **UI**: DaisyUI + Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Privacy**: No server uploads - everything runs in your browser

## Browser Requirements

These tools require a modern browser with WebAssembly support:

- **Chrome**: 57+ / Chromium 57+
- **Firefox**: 52+
- **Safari**: 11+
- **Edge**: 16+

## Performance

WebAssembly allows us to achieve near-native performance in the browser:

- **File Processing**: 2-3x faster than JavaScript implementations
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient memory management with predictable performance
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized WASM bundles under 2MB compressed
- **Load Time**: Fast initialization and caching for repeated use

## Open Source

All tools are open source and available on GitHub:

- [SVGN Core](https://github.com/twardoch/svgn) - The Rust implementation
- [Web Tools](https://github.com/twardoch/svgn/tree/main/docs) - Frontend code for these tools
